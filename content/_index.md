      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'

        I am deeply interested in researching reinforcement learning methods for planning and optimizaton, with a passion for improving the mathematical capabilities of machine learning models, primarily through the intersection of language models and reinforcement learning.

        I have previously worked as a student researcher on HCI for robotics and robotics teleoperation at the [Trinity Robotics and Innovation Lab](https://www.tcd.ie/mecheng/research/robotics-and-innovation-lab/). While a student I led the reinforcement learning team at in the autonomous department at [Formula Trinity](https://www.formulatrinity.ie/autonomous), where I organized workshops and led research into RL for autonomous racing vehicles.

        I spent 8 months as a student researcher at the [ADAPT Centre](https://www.adaptcentre.ie) under the supervision of Professor Vincent Wade, where I worked on machine learning for curriculum design in education.
        My Master's thesis focused on RL for guiding LLMs in the field of automated theorem proving, using the Lean language as a kernel for proving theorems. This work led to improvements in search efficiency over SOTA methods.

        I currently work as a software engineer at [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com)
