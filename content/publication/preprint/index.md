abstract: 
    The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently exacerbate performance gaps.
    To address this problem, student profiling becomes crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
