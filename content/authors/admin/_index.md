## About Me
I am a software engineer with a Master's in Computer Science from [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie). My current research interests include neural theorem proving, reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits and machine learning for mathematical and scientific discoveries. This mainly focuses on automated theorem proving and algorithm generation.

My background is in computer science and I have previously worked as a researcher in the [ADAPT Centre](https://www.adaptcentre.ie) in Trinity College Dublin where my work focused on user modelling for education, graph neural networks, and explainable AI. Alongside these subjects, I have experience in robotics, low-level optimization, and software engineering for high frequency trading.
I currently work as a software engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) where I work on the authentication team
